      The Left Behind series has been considered one of the greatest Christian fiction series 
      of its time, written by Tim LaHaye, an American Baptist evangelical minister, and now a 
      New York Times Bestselling author. In 1995, LaHaye published the first book in the series: 
      “Left Behind.” “Left Behind series” is about how biblical prophecies of the end times 
      could possibly play out, according to the Bible.
