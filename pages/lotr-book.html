      The Lord of the Rings is an epic high fantasy novel written by J.R.R. Tolkien, 
      which was later fitted as a trilogy. The story began as a sequel to Tolkien's 
      earlier fantasy book The Hobbit, and soon developed into a much larger story. 
      At publication, it was divided into The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers, 
      and The Return of the King.
